Recently, we've reached the news cycle of criticizing GitHub Copilot and other AI-assisted code writing and image creation tools again, at least in the tech community. I think it's a good time to reflect on the current state of AI and how it can help us to finally reform copyright law.

<a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> copilot, with &quot;public code&quot; blocked, emits large chunks of my copyrighted code, with no attribution, no LGPL license. For example, the simple prompt &quot;sparse matrix transpose, cs\_&quot; produces my cs_transpose in CSparse. My code on left, github on right. Not OK. <a href="https://t.co/sqpOThi8nf">pic.twitter.com/sqpOThi8nf</a>

In the corresponding [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515) theres a clear and negative sentiment towards AI-assisted code writing tools:

{% quote(author="enriquto", class="hackernews", url_text="link", url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515#33231362") %}
[...] it is notoriously not used by scipy.linalg.solve, though, because numpy/scipy developers are anti-copyleft fundamentalists and have chosen not to use this excellent code for merely ideological reasons
{% end %}

{% quote(author="mjr00", class="hackernews", url_text="link", url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515#33226972") %}
Same issue with Stable Diffusion/NovelAI and certain people's artwork (eg Greg Rutkowski) being obviously used as part of the training set. More noticeable in Copilot since the output needs to be a lot more precise.
Lawmakers need to jump on this stuff ASAP. [...]
{% end %}

Until now, I've been mostly ignoring these, because I don't think most of them are very productive. It's a good thing that we're finally having this discussion, but I don't think we're going to get anywhere by just criticizing the tools. We need to have a more constructive conversation about what we want to achieve with copyright law.
