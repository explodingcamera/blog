<!--
* I tried out kotlin, elixir
* Coming from a different mindset, too much context
* Code generation, too much boilerplate
* New Java/C# have the right idea: allow boilerplate free main code
* Good Library API design doesn't have magic and can be understand without knowlege of the programming language
