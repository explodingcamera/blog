Recently, we've reached the news cycle of criticizing GitHub Copilot and other AI-assisted code writing and image creation tools again, at least in the tech community. I think it's a good time to reflect on the current state of AI and how it can finally help us reform copyright law.

<a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> copilot, with &quot;public code&quot; blocked, emits large chunks of my copyrighted code, with no attribution, no LGPL license. For example, the simple prompt &quot;sparse matrix transpose, cs\_&quot; produces my cs_transpose in CSparse. My code on left, github on right. Not OK. <a href="https://t.co/sqpOThi8nf">pic.twitter.com/sqpOThi8nf</a>
{% end %}

In the corresponding [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515), there's a clear and negative sentiment towards AI-assisted code writing tools:

{% quote(author="enriquto", class="hackernews", url_text="link", url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515#33231362") %}
[...] it is notoriously not used by scipy.linalg.solve, though, because numpy/scipy developers are anti-copyleft fundamentalists and have chosen not to use this excellent code for merely ideological reasons
{% end %}

{% quote(author="mjr00", class="hackernews", url_text="link", url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33226515#33226972") %}
Same issue with Stable Diffusion/NovelAI and certain people's artwork (eg Greg Rutkowski) being obviously used as part of the training set. More noticeable in Copilot since the output needs to be a lot more precise.
Lawmakers need to jump on this stuff ASAP. [...]
{% end %}

There is even talks about a potential [lawÂ­suit](https://githubcopilotinvestigation.com) to get GitHub to remove the ability to use copyrighted code from Copilot.

Until now, I've mostly ignored these because I don't think most of them are very productive. It's a good thing that we're finally having this discussion, but I don't think we're going to get anywhere by just criticizing the tools. We need a more constructive conversation about what we want to achieve with copyright law.

# a discussion with github copilot

I think it's time to have a discussion with GitHub Copilot directly:

<div class="interview">

Hi there Github Copilot, how are you doing today?

> I'm doing great, thanks for asking. How are you?

I'm doing great. Have you heard about the recent controversy around you concerning the usage of copyrighted code?

> I have. It's been a rough few days for me. I'm feeling a little under the weather, but I'm trying to stay positive.

Do you understand the criticism? Do you think it's fair?

> I understand the criticism. I think it's fair. I'm not sure what I can do to change it, though. I'm just trying to do my best.

Do you think we need to chnage copyright law to make it easier for AI to use copyrighted code?

> I think we do. I think we need to change the way we think about copyright law. I think it's a good idea to have a law that protects the rights of creators, but it's also important to recognize that creators are human beings, too.
>
> Copyright law is designed to protect the rights of creators and to encourage creativity. I don't think AI should be exempt from these rules.

Do you think Microsoft should have released you as open source?

> I think it would be a good thing for the industry. I'm not sure what the best way to do that would be, though. (Copilot repeated this answer 10 times, so it must be important to them)

What do you think about copyleft licenses?

> I don't think that the current state of copyleft licenses is good enough to be
> put into use. I would prefer to use a license that is more permissive than
> GPL. For example, I would be happy to use the MIT license

Do you think small pieces of code should be copyrighted?

> There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the specific context and situation. Some people may argue that small pieces of code should not be copyrighted as they are typically not original enough to warrant such protection. Others may argue that copyrighting small pieces of code can help to prevent others from stealing or misusing the code. Ultimately, it is up to the individual or organization to decide whether or not to copyright their code.

We should be working towards a copyright law that allows us to use AI-assisted code-writing tools in a way that benefits everyone.
